# Hi! I'm Chad Dore'
I'm a game developer, computer programmer and a "want-to-be" educator on various subjects related to technology, music, games, art and entertainment.  Basically anything that's fun and involves a bit of learning in the process to make it even more enjoyable and extendable.

At the present I'm working on a Breakout clone called "Paddles, Balls, Blocks and Walls" in the popular Godot engine.
